# global_sustainable_equity_fund
 
This project enables scraping and storing the data of the "NN (L) Global Sustainable Equity" fund as well as time series forecasting for the following 10 business days.

A Conda virtual environment has been added to the “gsef” folder, including all the necessary libraries.

A batch script “update_gsef_data.bat” has been added to automate running the process through the virtual environment.

The "pmdarima" statistical library has been used for the time series analysis and forecast.
