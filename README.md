# global_sustainable_equity_fund
 
This project enables scraping and storing the data of the "NN (L) Global Sustainable Equity" fund as well as time series forecasting for the following 10 business days.

The "pmdarima" statistical library has been used for the time series analysis and forecast.

An extra batch script “update_gsef_data.bat” has been added to automate running the process through the virtual environment.
