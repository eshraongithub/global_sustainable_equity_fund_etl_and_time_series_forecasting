The "pmdarima" statistical library has been used for the time series analysis and forecast.

A python notebook + script have been added to perform each of the following analyses and processes separately:
- ETL from the Financial Times website.

- Bollinger Bands (20 days).

A descriptive analysis python notebook is also included.
